# tps-proc
bash shell scripts for processing and analyzing TPS files for geometric morphometrics

INTRODUCTION
-------

The tps-proc repository contains a series of shell scripts that we have been using for processing .TPS files generated in [tpsDig] software by James Rohlf (REF; link#). Development of this code is on-going, and while the only script currently available is the tps2classifiers script, which pulls sample information from image names contained in one or more .TPS files in the working directory.
